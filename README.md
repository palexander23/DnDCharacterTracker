# Seth Tracker

This is a Python Script build as a learning exercise for the PyQt5 GUI Library. It is used to track various stats regarding a D&D Character.

## Functionality

The program presents a GUI interface to the user containing labelled spin boxes allowing the user to set the value of a character's stats such as HP or spell slots.  
When a value is set, the script saves the change to a CSV file in the background.
